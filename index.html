            As a part of astronomy, astrophysics deals with the study of
            celestial bodies by applying the laws of physics and chemistry. The
            field applies laws of different subjects like thermodynamics,
            molecular physics, relativity, particle physics, etc. This book
            unfolds the innovative aspects of astrophysics, which will be
            crucial for the holistic understanding of the subject matter

            Bang? Are there other universes? What makes stars shine? Where does
